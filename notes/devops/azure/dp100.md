# Designing and implementing a data science solution on Azure

## Explore and configure the Azure Machine Learning workspace 

### 1. Azure Machine Learning Platform

- **Azure Machine Learning (AML)**  
  A cloud-based platform that provides tools and services for data scientists to train, deploy, and manage machine learning models on Microsoft Azure.

- **Azure Machine Learning Workspace**  
  The central top-level resource in AML where all resources and assets (datasets, models, compute, etc.) are organized and managed for machine learning projects.

- **Azure Machine Learning Studio**  
  A web portal interface launched from the Azure portal to create, manage, and use Azure Machine Learning resources and assets.

- **Azure Machine Learning Service**  
  The service in an Azure subscription that allows creation and management of machine learning workspaces and resources.

### 2. Compute Services

- **Compute**  
  The cloud infrastructure that provides the computational power needed to run machine learning workflows (training, inference, etc.).

- **Compute Instance**  
  A virtual machine (VM) in Azure specifically provisioned for individual development and experimentation, often used for notebooks or debugging.

- **Compute Clusters**  
  Scalable, on-demand clusters of CPU or GPU nodes used to distribute and accelerate training jobs in the cloud.

- **Kubernetes Clusters**  
  Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters used to orchestrate containers for scalable model deployment or batch inferencing.

- **Attached Computes**  
  External compute resources, like an existing AKS cluster, connected to the Azure Machine Learning workspace to run jobs.

- **Serverless Computes**  
  Compute resources that run workloads without the user managing the underlying infrastructure, typically for lightweight or event-driven ML tasks.

### 3. Storage and Data Management

- **Datastore**  
  References or connections to Azure data storage services (e.g., Blob Storage, Data Lake) where data is stored outside the workspace.

- **Azure Storage Account**  
  An Azure resource created alongside the workspace, providing persistent storage (blobs, files) used by the workspace for datasets, outputs, and other artifacts.

- **Data Asset**  
  A specific file or folder registered in the workspace that points to actual data within datastores or storage services.

- **Azure Key Vault**  
  A secure service where sensitive information like connection strings, secrets, and credentials are stored. Used to protect datastore connection information.

### 4. Identity and Access Management

- **Azure Portal**  
  The primary web interface for managing all Azure services, including the Azure Machine Learning workspace and resources.

- **Access Control**  
  Mechanism to assign and manage permissions for users or teams to access Azure resources.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Azure’s authorization system to manage access by assigning roles to users/groups, controlling who can view or manage specific resources such as the AML workspace or compute.

### 5. Development and Deployment Assets

- **Models**  
  The trained machine learning artifacts created with frameworks like Scikit-learn or PyTorch, registered in the workspace with name and version for deployment and tracking.

- **Environments**  
  Define the software dependencies, environment variables, and configurations required to run machine learning scripts or code on compute resources. Stored as container images in Azure Container Registry.

- **Components**  
  Reusable code units or steps (e.g., data preprocessing, model training) that can be assembled into pipelines within the workspace. Components specify code, environment, and version.

- **Pipelines**  
  Orchestrated workflows built by chaining components to automate complex machine learning tasks.

### 6. Machine Learning Workflow Features

- **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**  
  A feature that automates the process of algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning to find the best performing model for a dataset.

- **Notebooks**  
  Interactive code environments hosted in the workspace, typically run on compute instances, used for exploration and experimentation.

- **Jobs**  
  Executions of scripts or training runs submitted to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. Jobs store all inputs, outputs, and logs for reproducibility.

### 7. Supporting Azure Services

- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**  
  A private registry service in Azure to store and manage container images, such as those created for environments in AML.

### Relationships and Summary

- The **Azure Machine Learning workspace** ties everything together: it contains compute resources (compute instances, clusters, Kubernetes, serverless), data storage (datastores, data assets), and assets (models, environments, components).

- **Access control (RBAC)** ensures proper permissions for users to interact with these resources safely.

- **Compute** is essential for running experiments, either interactively via notebooks on compute instances or through jobs running scripts on clusters or serverless compute.

- **Environments** package dependencies and configurations needed for consistent execution across compute.

- **Automated ML** is a high-level feature to speed up model training without manually testing algorithms or hyperparameters.

### Details Left Behind or Summarized

#### 1. Specific Mention of "Overview Page"

- The **Overview page** of the workspace in the Azure portal, where you launch Azure Machine Learning Studio, was not explicitly called out.
- This is more of a **UI navigation detail** rather than a core Azure service or concept.

#### 2. Grouping Workspaces by Organizing Principles

- The idea that workspaces can be grouped by:
  - Projects
  - Deployment environments (e.g., test/production)
  - Teams
- This was mentioned but **not listed as a separate concept** because it’s more of a best practice or organizational strategy than a service or feature.

#### 3. Versioning Specifics on Assets and Models

- Versioning for models, environments, components, and data assets was included generally.
- The detailed explanation of **why** versioning is important (e.g., to track specific deployed models or data files) was condensed.

#### 4. Compute Cost Concerns and Role Separation

- The point that compute is the most **cost-intensive resource** was summarized.
- Best practice that **only administrators create/manage compute resources**, while data scientists just use them, was mentioned under governance/access control but not emphasized as a separate best practice.

#### 5. Azure Storage Account Auto-Creation with Workspace

- It was noted that the workspace is linked to an Azure Storage account.
- The detail that **four datastores come pre-added automatically** with the workspace was simplified to just "datastores exist and you can add more."

#### 6. Details on Code Reuse and Components

- Creating components to enable **code reuse across projects** was mentioned.
- Example use cases such as:
  - Normalize data
  - Train regression model
  - Validate model
- These were **not individually called out**.

#### 7. Notebooks Stored in File Share of Azure Storage

- Files created or cloned in notebooks are stored in the **file share of the Azure Storage account** associated with the workspace.
- This storage detail was mentioned briefly but not as a standalone point.

#### 8. Environment Image Storage in Azure Container Registry (ACR)

- The nuance that the environment image is stored in ACR **only when used for the first time** was mentioned.
- This detail was summarized as simply "environments stored in ACR" to keep things less complex.
